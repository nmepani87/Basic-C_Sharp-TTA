 <h3>Car Insurance</h3>
 <p>In this project, I created a web application based upon something similar to what a car insurance company would have. In here the user is asked various questions and depending on outcomes to certain questions their quotation for car insurance can increase.</p>
 
  <h3>Student</h3>
 <p>In this short project, I learnt how to use Code First development and create a console application that would create a student database. In here the user is asked a few questions and that information is stored to the database.</p>
 
  <h3>Misc</h3>
 <p>There are also various assignments that show learning of .NET Core, .NET Framework, SQL Server (connecting to a Database created within or an external one) and use of various methods/functions. </p>
